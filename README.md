## Features

<div align="left">

* Keep all of your favorite AzuraCast Radio stations in one place!
* See live metadata and song duration/progress via the use of the [AzuraCast NowPlaying Static API](https://www.azuracast.com/docs/developers/now-playing-data/#static-now-playing-json-file)*
* Listen to your radio stations on the road with Android Auto support
* Discover new radio stations via utilization of the Discovery page!
* Enjoy your radio stations on all of your Android devices thanks to the [Material 3 Adaptive library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3-adaptive)


\**If a station does not allow access to this API, the app will try its best. This API is enabled by default by AzuraCast stations so unless a station specifically disables access to the API, the station should work just fine*
